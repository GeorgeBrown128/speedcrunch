Installation
============

Microsoft Windows
-----------------
SpeedCrunch for Windows requires Windows Vista or newer (32-bit and 64-bit versions).
You can use choose either to use either the installer or the portable
version of SpeedCrunch. Both of these are available from `the SpeedCrunch website`_.

.. _the SpeedCrunch website: http://speedcrunch.org

The installer installs SpeedCrunch on your system and creates an entry in the menu
to launch it. This process requires administrator rights.

Alternatively, you may use the portable version of SpeedCrunch, which is distributed
as a ``.zip`` archive. This version requires no installation, simply extract it to
a folder of your choice and run ``speedcrunch.exe``. In addition, this version of
the software is fully portable: it stores all its settings and user data next to the
executable so the entire directory can be copied to e.g. another computer and run
there.

Linux

Since the large number and variety of Linux distributions makes it impossible to
consider all of them here, this section only describes the SpeedCrunch installation
process for the most popular ones. If you use another distribution, we expect that
you will know better than us how to get software for your system.

Ubuntu & Debian

SpeedCrunch is available from the package repositories on both Ubuntu and Debian. It can be installed
from the Ubuntu Software Centre or using the command line::

    sudo apt-get install speedcrunch
